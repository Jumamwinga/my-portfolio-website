# my-portfolio-website
This is my first portfolio website since I began this web development journey. 
I designed it during the Power Learn Software Development Schorlaship. 
I am currently looking foward to join the Equity Bank Tech Apprecentiship this June 2024. 
I hope this is going to be my breakthrough into the tech journey as a tech enthustiast. 
Thank you Power Learn for this schorlarship.
